          <p>
            M&amp;A integration introduces technical complexity fast: overlapping tools, duplicated alerts, partial
            ownership, and inconsistent service maps. The biggest reliability failures during integration usually do not
            come from one bad migration step. They come from ambiguity that accumulates across many small decisions.

                         [Unified Severity + Ownership Model]</pre>

          <p>
            This article outlines a practical monitoring integration approach that keeps service reliability stable while
            consolidating infrastructure and operating models.
          </p>

          <h2>What goes wrong first in M&amp;A monitoring</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Coverage fragmentation:</strong> key systems are partially monitored across environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Alert duplication:</strong> separate tools page different teams for the same event.</li>
            <li><strong>Ownership drift:</strong> inherited services lose clear accountability during re-orgs.</li>
            <li><strong>Access asymmetry:</strong> responders cannot access logs, traces, or dashboards consistently.</li>
            <li><strong>Metric mismatch:</strong> teams define severity and SLO semantics differently.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            These issues are not independent. If ownership is unclear, coverage quality drops. If access is fragmented,
            incident duration increases. If severity definitions differ, escalation quality degrades.
          </p>

          <h2>Phase 0: Build one integration map before moving tools</h2>
          <p>
            Before touching observability tooling, build a baseline map that answers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which services are tier-0 and tier-1?</li>
            <li>Which telemetry signals exist today per service?</li>
            <li>Who owns each service at code level and operationally?</li>
            <li>Which systems are customer-critical and time-sensitive?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This map becomes your source of truth for sequence planning. Without it, consolidation turns into a stream
            of unprioritized migrations that create hidden reliability risk.
          </p>

          <h2>Phase 1: Standardize semantics, not platforms</h2>
          <p>
            The first integration milestone is semantic alignment. You need a shared language before a shared toolset:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Common severity taxonomy</li>
            <li>Shared incident priority model</li>
            <li>Unified service and ownership metadata</li>
            <li>Consistent SLI and SLO naming conventions</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This phase unlocks cleaner incident coordination immediately, even while multiple tools remain in place.
          </p>

          <h2>Phase 2: Consolidate by service criticality, not by team preference</h2>
          <p>
            A common anti-pattern is consolidating whichever systems are easiest first. That usually delays risk
            reduction. Instead, prioritize by production criticality and user impact:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Tier-0 user-facing services</li>
            <li>Core platform dependencies</li>
            <li>High-change internal services</li>
            <li>Long-tail services with low risk impact</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            This sequence keeps reliability posture visible where the business impact is highest.
          </p>

          <h2>Phase 3: Run a dual-operation period with strict expiry</h2>
          <p>
            You will likely need temporary dual-tool operation. Make it time-bound and explicit:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Define dual-run windows per domain</li>
            <li>Track parity metrics between old and target systems</li>
            <li>Set decommission criteria in advance</li>
            <li>Assign one owner for tool retirement decisions</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Dual-run without expiry creates permanent complexity. The longer it stays, the worse alert quality and
            ownership hygiene become.
          </p>

          <h2>Metrics that prove consolidation is working</h2>
          <p>Track a small, high-signal metric set weekly:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Alert duplication rate</li>
            <li>Coverage completeness for tier-0 services</li>
            <li>Median incident acknowledgment and mitigation times</li>
            <li>Onboarding time for integrated teams</li>
            <li>Percent of services with complete owner metadata</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If these metrics do not improve, consolidation is cosmetic, not operational.
          </p>

          <h2>Leadership pattern that prevents reliability regressions</h2>
          <p>
            The highest-leverage leadership move in M&amp;A integration is to tie program governance directly to
            reliability outcomes. Run a single operating cadence that includes platform engineering, SRE, and key
            application owners. Integration decisions should be made with incident data, not with isolated architecture
            debates.
          </p>

          <h2>Closing note</h2>
          <p>
            M&amp;A monitoring strategy is really an operating model challenge disguised as a tooling challenge.
            Consolidate semantics first, critical services next, and ownership always. When that sequence is respected,
            integration can accelerate platform quality rather than destabilize it.
